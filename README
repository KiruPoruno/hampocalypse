This is a for fun project, which when run recursively creates images of
ham with random names, making it very hard to remove. I wouldn't
recommend running this on any folder that you care about, as there's no
easy way to clean said folders, and if the folder is deep enough the
folder will get very big.

To run it simply download a release on the releases page and run it:

  <executable> [folders]

Where executable is either the .exe, Linux binary or macOS binary. To
build these simply run:

  make compile

Which'll make the files in the build/ folder.


All the images are inside src/images/, more can be added with ease.
